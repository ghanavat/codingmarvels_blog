# Coding Marvels
This is the source code of my personal blog, https://codingmarvels.com. It is a fully static site running on Jekyll.

I will talk about WebAssembly, and mostly Blazor as well as other technologies and issues/solutions. If there is anything wrong with my blog posts etc, please submit a pull request, or email me.
