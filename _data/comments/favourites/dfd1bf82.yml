  Hi,
  As a veteran professional investigator, acknowledged that I really love notation with pen on a piece of paper, which is, of course, a habit. And I believe that any digital work will end with a note on paper.

  But when I concentrate on an important subject in my research, that obviously is complicated, I need to collect items faster than possible. It is not possible with pen noting. So I need to digital world.

  When you are collecting items (such as books, articles...) the most important things is time lapse, which may cause forgetfulness or any change in your soft or hard tools such as your laptop, OS, apps. In this case, there is the risk of losing all your data or at least having to spend a lot of time to reminding and retrieving them.

  A researcher must to work hard but simply, not complicated. Therefore, I believe that it is better to use public and conventional facilities. It is better for him to spend his own initiative on his subject matter, not on marginal issues.
