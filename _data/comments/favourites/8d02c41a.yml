message: "I tend to use a lot of tabs which I keep active for long periods of time (even months). It's only after a long time or if I am having a 'spring clean' that they them become bookmarked links. Recently I have also been trying out some apps/extensions.\r\nI am using Tabli and Tab Session Manager which can also manage links/bookmarks or use tab sessions as a type of bookmark. Both have pros & cons but I have yet to find a complete solution that manages both bookmark/links and tabs totally satisfactorily. "
