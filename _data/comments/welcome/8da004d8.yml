message: Vincent, thanks for your comment.The reply functionality is being implemented. In regards to your second point, yes I'm aware of that, and I'm happy with it. Staticman didn't look like a bad solution at all. However setting it up for my blog was time consuming and I could not afford that. Jekyll-Comments is best suited for what I need for now. It uses pretty much the same approach compare to Staticman.
