  Nonetheless, there're some drawbacks.



  1. There might be several "main comments", which are comments *without* a reply target under one post.  For example, you might refer to https://networkhobo.com/2017/12/30/hugo-staticman-nested-replies-and-e-mail-notifications/.

  2. Jekyll-comments only works for Jekyll, whereas [Staticman](https://staticman.net) works for *any* static blog generator since PR/MR's are pushed to GitHub/GitLab repo.
