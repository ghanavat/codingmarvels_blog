Hello, thanks for visiting my blog. I know it's pretty quiet here at the moment. This is because I am setting up the gears and putting up things where they should be.

Coding marvels is my personal blog and I will be focusing on WebAssembly and mostly Blazor! Have you heard of Blazor? No? Yes? Doesn't matter if the answer is yes or no. We're gonna have a lot of fun together and we will figure out exciting stuff as we go along, which will help this blog to evolve and give values to others.
