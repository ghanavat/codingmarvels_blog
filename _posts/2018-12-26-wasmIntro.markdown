WASM is a short for WebAssembly. I am working on an introduction to WASM in my own way and my own language! Ha!

If you want to know what it is, please keep an eye on this page. I guess everyone or every WASM begineer would a little bit struggle to understand or make sense of WebAssembly at the first place. This is including myself by the way.

Please hang on a little bit. I will update this post with whatever you need to know about this technology to start.
